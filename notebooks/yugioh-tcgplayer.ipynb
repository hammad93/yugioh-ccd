The requirements in robots.txt must be adhered to. Here are some of the fields and what they mean\n\n### User-agent: *\nThe User-agent field is located in every request and can indicate if the request is coming from a web browser, operating system, and so on. The wildcard parameter, *, means 'All', and in this case there are no restrictions in the User-agent.\n### Crawl-Delay: 10\nIn seconds, it describes the amount of delay between requests. This is important as it makes sure web scrapers are not overloading the server. There are an incredible number of methods to scrape but some of the fastest ones can make over 1 million requests all at once. \n### Allow: /\nThis explains which parts of the web application or URL can be scraped. a '/' indicates the root directory which means that everything is allowed, pending understanding of what is disallowed.\n### Disallow: /*?*seller=*\nCombined with the allowed statement, this provides endpoints or parts of the URL that are not allowed. In this case, TCGPlayer doesn't allow requests that scrape seller information as a parameter indicated by the wildcards. Query parameters in the URL are specified as ?parameter_name=parameter_value . We will also respect seller privacy even when we have seller data from a page that is allowed.\n### Sitemap: https://www.tcgplayer.com/sitemap/index.xml\nThis provides a \"hardcoded\" list of links and metadata that can understand what it's about.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from xml.dom.minidom import parseString\nsitemap = parseString(requests.get('https://www.tcgplayer.com/sitemap/index.xml').content)","metadata":{},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# get all yugioh sitemaps\nyugioh_maps = []\nfor loc in sitemap.getElementsByTagName('loc') : # all TCGPlayer collections like Pokemon or Magic\n    current_map = loc.childNodes[0].data\n    if \"yugioh\" in current_map :\n        yugioh_maps.append(current_map)","metadata":{},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## TCGPlayer Yugioh Sitemaps\nNot all sites have a sitemap defined, but understanding the structure of it, here are some conclusions,\n\n- Each yugioh map XML file has the list of cards\n- We're interested in the URL's that define \"product\" instead of other's like \"categories\" or \"search\"\n- The links seem to be sorted by newest to oldest products\n- The newest products may not have any sales\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(yugioh_maps)","metadata":{},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":"['https://www.tcgplayer.com/sitemap/yugioh.0.xml', 'https://www.tcgplayer.com/sitemap/yugioh.1.xml']\n"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Advanced Web Scraping\nIf we're lucky, we can get all the data we need using the built in Python tools like **requests**. However, some web apps run Javascript that provide the necessary tools. In our case, there's some pertinent sales data that is loaded dynamically from TCG Player. We could break it down and make multiple simple requests but it would also multiply our processing time by the same factor. This is because the **robots.txt** asks to make 1 request per 10 seconds. The data gap between putting a URL into a modern web browser and using Python's simple requests can be filled by using advanced web scraping libraries.\n\nThis takes the \"engine\" from the web browsers, referred to as \"web drivers\", and allows us to process the data similarly to what we experience from it. Additionally, some web browsers use different engines. Here, we will install the library in Python known as **playwright** and a few web drivers for compatibility. Other libraries are available including **Selenium** but it requires manual web driver installion. This will half the scraping time because we would need to make 2 requests from a simple request and at more than 33,000 cards to scrape, the time savings can equal to days.\n\n###
